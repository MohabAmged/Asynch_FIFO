# Asynchronous FIFO 
In asynchronous FIFO, data read and write operations use different clock frequencies. Since write and read clocks are not synchronized, it is referred to as asynchronous FIFO. Usually, these are used in systems where data need to pass from one clock domain to another which is generally termed as ‘clock domain crossing’. Thus, asynchronous FIFO helps to synchronize data flow between two systems working on different clocks.
